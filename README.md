## 👋 Hey, I'm Rishabh Singh Yadav !

### My Skills 
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,js,c,cpp,py,mysql)](https://skillicons.dev)

I'm a student and web developer who’s always curious and constantly building cool (sometimes weird) stuff on the web. Whether it’s front-end experiments or back-end tinkering, I love bringing ideas to life through code.

### 🔧 What I Do
- 🌐 Web development — full-stack vibes, mostly JavaScript, React, and Node.js
- 📚 Always learning something new 
- 🧪 Love experimenting and creating side projects just for fun (check out my repos!)

### 🎌 A Little More About Me
- 👨‍🎓 Currently studying and coding my way through the chaos
- 🤓 Curious by nature — I ask a *lot* of questions
- 🍜 Big anime lover / otaku — my productivity fuel is code + anime in the background
- ☕ Runs on coffee, memes, and late-night coding sessions

### 🤝 Let's Connect!
Open to collabs, cool ideas, or just geeking out over tech or anime. Feel free to reach out!
